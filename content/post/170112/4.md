Why shouldn’t you use **operator\<** when comparing iterators in the code below (container
is some sort of STL container):
<!--more-->
```
for ( auto it = begin ( container ); it < end( container ); ++it )
    // do something with it
```



### Answer:
Only random-access iterators support comparison with operator<. This will not compile with containers that doesn't support random-access. Instead operator!= should be used.
