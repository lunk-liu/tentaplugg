In which situation would one chose to declare a destructor pure virtual?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
You could use a pure virtual destructor in a base class if you want it to be abstract but have valid implementations for all other virtual functions (or have no other virtual functions). You still have to add an implementation for the destructor:

```
struct A
{
    virtual ~A() = 0;
};
A::~A() = default;
```
