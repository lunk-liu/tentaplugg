What is meant by the keyword constexpr and why is it sometimes needed?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
a constexpr funciton is a function that the compiler can calculate at compile time to create constant values.
```
constexpr int foo(int n)
{
    return n+1;
}
```
The return value can be used where the compiler requires a constant expression, such as a template argument:
```std::array<int, foo(3)> arr;```
