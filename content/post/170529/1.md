What does it mean that a type is contextually convertible to bool?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
A type that is contextually convertible to bool can be used as a boolean expression such as in an if-statement. To make your own type convertible, a type converting operator has to be implemented. bool is a special case in that even if the operator is marked explicit, the compiler can call it in a situation that requires a type that is contextually convertible.

```

struct My_Type
{
    explicit operator bool() const { return true; }
};

//...

My_Type t;
if ( t )
{
    //...
}

```
