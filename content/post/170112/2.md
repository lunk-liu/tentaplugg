A forwarding reference and an r-value reference are declared in the same way (**Type &&**),
but are semantically very different. Why?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
A forwarding reference is a template parameter defined as **T&&** such as 

```
template <typename T>
void foo(T && ref)
{

}
```
A forwarding reference will work with any type having any expression categorization due to reference collapsing. An r-value reference will only bind to temporaries (r-values).
