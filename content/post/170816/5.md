What is the difference between the noexcept operator and the noexcept specifier?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
noexcept specifier is used to mark a function as noexcept. A noexcept function mustn't throw any exceptions (or program will abort). Can be written as follows:
```    
    void fun() noexcept;        // fun may not throw
    void fun() noexcept(true);  // fun may not throw
    void fun() noexcept(false); // fun may throw
```
noexcept operator can only be used in the noexcept specifier context and can be used to check if an expression is noexcept or not. This is usually used for general functions. An example is std::swap that is noexcept if the type to swap values has noexcept move assignment and construction:
```
    template <typename T>
    void swap(T & a, T & b) 
        noexcept(  // noexcept specifier
        noexcept(  // noexcept operator
        std::is_noexcept_move_constructable_v<T> &&
        std::is_noexcept_move_assignable_v<T>
        )
    );
```
