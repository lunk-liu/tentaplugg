Give one code example of where the compiler uses ADL for name lookup.
<!--more-->
### Answer:
ADL or Argument Dependant Lookup is used by the compiler to find the correct function to call (which namespace to find it in) depending on the namespace of the arguments passed to that function. 
A very common example is a call to a formatted output operator where it's difficult to qualify the namespace name:
```
std::cout << std::string{"hello"};
```
All arguments are in namespace std so even if I have to qualify the namespace for each argument, the correct overload is still found.
