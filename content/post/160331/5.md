Give an example of a delegating constructor.
<!--more-->
### Answer:
A delegating constructor is a constructor that calls another constructor for THE SAME class. The call MUST be in the member initializer list.
```
class Foo
{
    Foo(int i, double d) : vi{i}, di{d} {}
    Foo(int i) : Foo{i,0.0} {} // delegating constructor call
}
```
