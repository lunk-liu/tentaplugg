A function-try-block is sometimes good when defining constructors. Why are they especially
good in that use-case?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
A function-try-block is the only way of catching exceptions from initialization of data members: 
```
struct S
{
    S() try : mem_{operation_that_can_throw()}
    {
        // ctor body
    }
    catch ( ... )
    {
        // handle exception
    }
    T mem_;
};
```
