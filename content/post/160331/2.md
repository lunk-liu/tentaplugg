In C++, it is possible to create an unnamed namespace. What is an unnamed namespace and what is it used for?
<!--more-->
### Answer:
An unnamed namespace is a namespace without a name (duh). Everything declared in an unnamed namespace is automatically used directly after the namespace declaration (just like you hadn't had the namespace). The great thing about unnamed namespaces is that they are local to that specific file, i.e. the declarations cannot be accessed from outside the file.
