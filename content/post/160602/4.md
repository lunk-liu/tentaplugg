What is the difference between implementation defined behavior and undefined behavior?
<!--more-->

Implementation defined behavior is still valid behavior, only that it could be different on other systems. Simple example is the size of a pointer. A program with undefined behavior is faulty and might "work" but you can't expect anything to work.
