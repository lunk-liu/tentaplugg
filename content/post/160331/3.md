Give two different uses of the keyword ``mutable`` and describe the effect of ``mutable`` in each case.

### Answer:
There are two (and only two) places where mutable can be used according to the standard:

    1. When declaring a non-static, non-const, non-reference member to make it possible to change that member in a const expression such as from a const-declared member function or on a const object.

    2. Together with a lambda to be able to change the members of the created closure object: 
       ```[var]() mutable {++var;}```
