Consider the following function. Why is this interface a bad design? (hint, think about ownership...)
```
X* compute( /*some args*/ ) {
    X* res = new X{};
    // do something with res 
    return res;
}
```

### Answer:
By returning a raw pointer, we will leave it up to the user of our function to deallocate the resource.
The problem here is of course that a raw pointer could also point to some static memory that cannot be
deallocated.
