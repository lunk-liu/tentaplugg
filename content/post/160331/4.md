Give two ways of supplying the compiler with implicit type conversion to or from a user-defined type.
<!--more-->
### Answer:
Let's say we have two types, T and U. The following example shows two examples of conversion, via a type converting constructor (constructor taking ONE argument of the type we want to convert from) and a type converting operator.

```
class T
{
    T(U) {...} // converting from U to T via a constructor
    operator U() {...} // conversion operator, from T to U
};
```
