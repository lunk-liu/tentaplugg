Give, with either text or a short (1-5 simple statements each) code example, two examples of undefined behavior.
<!--more-->
### Answer:
There are lots of examples on undefined behavior but here are two simple ones:
* Integer overflow (though not all integral types): INT_MAX + 1
* Dereferencing pointer that doesn't refer to legal value: 
```
int * p;
*p = 4;
```
