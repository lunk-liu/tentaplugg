Assume you have definitions for the following functions:
```
void fun(int , short );
void fun(int , double );
```
The call **fun(2,3)** will give an ambiguous overload. Why?


### Answer:
The problem is (of course) due to type conversions. An int can be implicitly converted to both double and short and both will give possible loss of precision.
