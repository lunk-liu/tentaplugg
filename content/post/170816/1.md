Give a reason for why the language needs the virtual keyword from a viewpoint of the zero overhead principle?

<!--more-->
### Answer:
The virtual keyword tells the compiler that a function can be used in a polymorphic context. Polymorphism involves dynamic dispatch during runtime, even if the function isn't overloaded. If this was default behavior for all classes, an overhead would be added in all programs - even if your class doesn't use polymorphism. This would break the zero overhead principle.

In C++, a virtual function will usually give both runtime and memory overhead.
