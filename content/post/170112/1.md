The standard library has a function **std::addressof** that is used in generic code to find
the address of an object. Usually, the **operator &** is used for finding addresses of objects,
why do you think they added a function as well?

### Answer:
Main reason is to safeguard against overloads of **operator&** for user-defined types. These can return anything and they might need the actual address. Of course the name **addressof**is a better name as well.
