Given the following declarations, explain why the call ``max(i,d)`` will give an error. Make a possible fix in the call to make it compile.
```
template <typename T> 
T max(T, T);

int i; 
double d ;
```
<!--more-->
### Answer:
The function is parameterized on one type. Calling it with two different types will not work.
The task is to change the call (not any of the declarations) and there are thus two different kind of solutions, explicitly converting one of the arguments or explicitly instantiate the function for a specific type:
```
max<double>(i,d);
max(static_cast<double>(i), d);
```
