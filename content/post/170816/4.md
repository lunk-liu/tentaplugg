### Question:
Suppose that we have a class C with an int member i with a constructor that initializes
i with an int value (see below). A problem with this implementation is that we are
also able to call this constructor with values that are convertible to int. Give the
declarations needed in the class to give compilation errors when the constructor is
called with values of type that is convertible to int (i.e. double, long, bool, char etc.).

```
class C
{
    int i;
public :
    C( int v ) : i{v} {}
};
```


### Answer:
One solution is with templates (showed during a seminar):
```
    class C
    {
      int i;
    public:
      C(int v): i{v} {}
      template <typename T>
      C(T) = delete;
    };
```
Here we allow the int version and then there is a template version. If we call it with int, the standard function will be called. If we call with any other type, the template version will be instantiated and then access will be controlled (=delete) and we will get a compilation failure.
